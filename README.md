This repository contains solutions of the compiler design individual assignment.
In the repository it has three types of solutions which are a theory,problem solving and an implmentation (code) part.

The theory part gives a detail explanation about the diffrence between determinstic and non-determinstic parsers.
The problem solving part solves the given grammer and constructs a parser tree.
The third part which is an implmentation. it has two separate files which solve two questions in the assignment.
  * The first is type_checker.c file which detects dereference type errors in pointer operations. It is written in c        programming language.
  * the second is parser.cpp which implement stack based c++ parser to check balanced parenthesis. It is written in c++     programming language obviously.
